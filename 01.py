# ML - the ability of computer to learn without explicitly programmed 

# ML Algos --1.Supervised , 2. Unsupervised 3. Recommender and Reinforcement Learning 

# supervised learnign (input - output mapings )
# in this type of ml models we give input and output data for the machine to learn 

# types of supervised learnign -
# 1.regression --> predict a number from a infinitely many possible outcomes 
# 2.classification-->the two no of outcome is only two in most cases , eg: cancer detection through photo of tumer , predict categories or class from a small set of possible outcomes 


# Unsupervised Machine Learning 
# unsupervised models gets trained on unlabelled models , resulting in forming their own labels and patterns for labelling ,and grouping,classifing,clustering data .this is called as unsupervised learning



# unsupervised Learning :data only comes with x , but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find the structure in the data .

# types of unsupervised learning 
# 1.clustering --> group similar data together 
# 2.anomaly detection -->  find unusual data
# 3.dimensionality reduction --> compress data using fewer numbers
